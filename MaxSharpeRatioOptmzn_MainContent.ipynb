    "**Portfolio Optimization** is a discipline that deals with the construction of portfolios from tradable assets such as stocks, bonds and securities, with the dual objectives of ***maximising the expected portfolio return*** and ***minimizing portfolio risk***. The problem models can turn complex when constraints, both linear/non-linear and  representing investor preferences, market norms, investment strategies, why even religious beliefs, are incorporated into them. \n",

    "Some of these optimization problem models have been  satisfactorily solved, if not efficiently,  using traditional methods. However, it needs to be realized that traditional methods despite their sophistication,   suffer from pitfalls such as dependence on  a suitable *starting point* or *initial point* in the search space from where the search for solution begins,  or the need to enumerate all sets of candidate solution sets to determine the best or optimal solution, which can be time consuming,  or  the quality or effectiveness of the optimal  solutions to the problems concerned. \n",
