    "**Portfolio Optimization** is a discipline that deals with the construction of portfolios from tradable assets such as stocks, bonds and securities, with the dual objectives of ***maximising the expected portfolio return*** and ***minimizing portfolio risk***. The problem models can turn complex when constraints, both linear/non-linear and  representing investor preferences, market norms, investment strategies, why even religious beliefs, are incorporated into them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these optimization problem models have been  satisfactorily solved, if not efficiently,  using traditional methods. However, it needs to be realized that traditional methods despite their sophistication,   suffer from pitfalls such as dependence on  a suitable *starting point* or *initial point* in the search space from where the search for solution begins,  or the need to enumerate all sets of candidate solution sets to determine the best or optimal solution, which can be time consuming,  or  the quality or effectiveness of the optimal  solutions to the problems concerned. \n",

    "The optimal asset allocation represented by the optimal weights and arrived at by SciPy's minimize solver has been shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 4 illustrates the same for a near-optimal minimal risk portfolio opted for by the investor and delivered by VitaOptimum Plus's Ccs solver. The characteristics of the optimal/near-optimal portfolios have been listed below the figures. \n",

    "It can be seen that for a Maximal Sharpe Ratio of 1.28 and Diversification Ratio of 1.39, the SciPy solver yields an optimal portfolio where nine of the 15 stocks selected by the investor have been excluded from investing (zero weights), which may not be acceptable to the investor. The practicality of the optimal solution given the investor's preference,  leaves much to be desired. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, VitaOptimum Plus's Ccs solver is able to deliver a minimal risk portfolio, near-optimal though, but with a larger Diversification Ratio of 1.41, as preferred by the investor.   It can be seen that the allocation of weights are distributed across assets lending to the practicality of the investment. As mentioned earlier, configuring array variable **qmeasures** can help control or enhance the behavior of the VitaOptimum Plus solver. "
